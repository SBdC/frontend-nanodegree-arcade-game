This game is a project from the Udacity Nanodegree Front-End Web Developement

## How to PLAY
Use your keyboard arrows to move the player around the canvas.
The objective is to gather three stars by reaching the water without touching any bug.
If you collide with a bug you will loose one of your three hearts.
Once there are no more hearts left, the game will be over.
